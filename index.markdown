### Welcome to saneax.github.io

Hi there! My name is @saneax, and I'm a software engineer with a passion for coding. 
When I'm not immersed in the world of technology, you can find me on the open road, 
exploring new places and soaking up the sights and sounds of the world around me. 

I have a deep appreciation for classical bhajans and enjoy listening to them
whenever I get the chance. Additionally, I have a keen interest in political affairs
and staying up-to-date with the latest developments in this ever-changing landscape.

Thanks for taking the time to get to know me a little better!
